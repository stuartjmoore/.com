                    <img src="1.png">
                    <p>I recently noticed that a few emails from colleagues had been going into my spam folder for a month or two now. I never check my spam folder (it's fill within a day), so this was easy to over look and it definitely caused a problem.</p>
                    <p>How did it happen? I reported the email as spam. I didn't mean to, it was a slip of mouse. Was it my fault for being careless, or Google's for putting two vastly opposite functions next to eachother?</p>
                    <img src="2.png">
                    <p>I archive a lot of emails. Keeping inbox zero consisently isn't easy. I sometimes delete an automated message that has no historical value. I rarely report spam, since Google does a great job.</p>
                    <p>Archiving has a pretty low risk, I can always unarchive it. Same with deleting, although it may be permently deleted in 30 days. Reporting spam is a high risk, not only will it be delete in 30 days, but the next few messages won't show up in your inbox.</p>
                    <p>Why are the two polar oposite buttons next to each other? Sure, all three buttons "move the email", but I don't always think of it in those terms. And how do I un-report spam? I still can't be sure that Google knows I made a mistake.</p>
                    <img src="3.png">
                    <p>Just a quick shift. It seems odd at first. "Back", "move email", "modifiy", "move", "more". Separating the three move buttons? Separating the action buttons by drop down buttons?</p>
                    <img src="4.png">
                    <p>There are two types of email: good and bad. Save and tag the good ones, delete and report the bad. The buttons are aligned to your thoughts, not the email.</p>
                    <p>What else? Maybe the "report spam" button could appear after you delete an email. Google already shows an "undo" link, a spam link wouldn't be much of a stretch. Of course, this would drastically decrease the number of people who report spam.</p>
